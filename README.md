# Color Heist: 
A color scheme generator built on top of [Lokesh Dhakar's](http://www.lokeshdhakar.com) [Color Thief](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief). The idea behind this small project was to organize colors drawn from an image into a basic color scheme (defined as css rules). Color Thief is packaged into the distribution of color-heist. 


# Usage:
Example uses jquery to select image.
```javascript
	var i = $(.image-wrapper img)[0];
	var ch = new ColorHeist();
	var scheme = ch.getColorScheme(i, "heist-scheme");
```
This will generate (and insert into the DOM), a stylesheet containing rules for the specified properties (below), with the string passed to getColorScheme as a prefix to each style rule. For example, one rule might be "heist-scheme-backgroundLight"

# Rules:
The rules generated by default are as follows. Please note, this is a relatively easy project to extend. Future iterations may see more customization options available to the getColorScheme function (eg. may accept property values and generate color rule for each property and color in the scheme)
```css
	.backgroundLight
	.backgroundLightAlt
	.backgroundDark
	.backgroundDarkAlt
	.backgroundLightHighlight
	.backgroundDarkHighlight
	.textLight
	.textDark
	.textHighlightLight
	.textHighlightDark
```




# Development:
To get up and running, clone the repo, and run:
```
  npm install
  bower install
```
To load npm modules and dependencies.
To compress js (for use in example file perhaps), run:
```
  gulp
```
The default task compresses the ColorHeist library along with the ColorThief source
